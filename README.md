### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?


Add your response here
Yes the topics were really helpful.Implementing API calls was very challenging yet important for this assignment. It was also important to learn the DOM which enabled me to seamlessly intergrate javascript functionality with the html of the website



* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

Add your response here

If I had more time I would have implemented the pop up feature which displays additional information about the movie includng a video trailer.  I would have also added animation features such as the image sizes changing on mouse over

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Add your response here
I was glad to have accomplished all of the required features including adapting to a situation where the API did not return appropriate image url and so I had to display a default image to capture this case.
One of my peers was able to implement the pop up feature which was really cool and I would have implemented it if I had more time and better understanding of it.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.
I primarily used W3 schools for reference
https://www.w3schools.com/

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

Special Shout out to TAs Nicholas and Moe who were on call even during the weeked to answer my questions.
